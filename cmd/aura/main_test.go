// TestEntryPoint verifies the main function structure
func TestEntryPoint(t *testing.T) {
	// The main function should:
	// 1. Call cmd.Execute()
	// 2. Handle errors by calling os.Exit(1)
	// 3. Not have any other logic

	// We can't test os.Exit behavior easily, but we can document expectations
	// The main function should be minimal and delegate to cmd.Execute()
